<p>A little girl named Anvi once found a strange glowing pebble near the riverbank. Curious, she picked it up and slipped it into her pocket. That night, when she held it close, the pebble whispered softly: “Make a wish, and I’ll show you the way.”

Anvi wished for an adventure. Suddenly, her room filled with golden light, and the pebble turned into a tiny floating lantern. It led her outside into the quiet forest, where fireflies danced in patterns that looked like secret maps.

Following them, she reached a hidden clearing with a tree that sparkled like the night sky. The tree spoke gently: “Every wish carries a path. Yours brought you here. Take one star from my branches, and it will guide you whenever you feel lost.”

Anvi plucked a tiny star and kept it close. From that day, whenever she felt scared, the star glowed softly, reminding her that courage and magic were always within her.</p>
